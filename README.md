# hello-world

Hi everyone!

Maik here, I would like to begin in the Linux world including scripting. To be a Linux System Admin would be my first goal. I am going to prepare for the Red Hat Cert. It is going to be hard but if you like something it is going to be easy to have good results.
See you near around!
